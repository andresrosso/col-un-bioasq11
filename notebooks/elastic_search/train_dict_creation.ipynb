Patient information was collected from the hospital information system and the e-pulse system.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nFemales accounted for 50.2% of our patients and their mean age was 47.9\\xa0±\\xa014.8 (19-88) years. About 14.3% (n: 45) of the individuals were 65\\xa0years of age and older, 20.6% (n: 65) of our patients were smoking and 70.2% (n: 221) of our patients were treated at home. A total of 133 patients had at least one comorbid disease. The patients most frequently reported cough, dyspnoea, weakness, myalgia and diarrhoea. The most common symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, weakness and myalgia in the 1st month. Initial D-dimer, initial CRP and the values of platelet, D dimer and CRP in the 1st month were detected to be higher in patients with persistent symptoms when the laboratory values of patients whose symptoms continue after 1\\xa0month were examined. It was determined that the symptoms had persisted in patients who had been hospitalised, had dual therapy, had comorbid diseases and had more common pathologies in their pulmonary imaging.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nSymptoms may persist for a long time in hospitalised patients, in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia and concomitant chronic diseases and in patients with high D-dimer and high CRP at the time of admission. Patients are informed that their symptoms may last for a long time, unnecessary hospital admissions can be avoided.',\n",

Older adults are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and hence trauma symptoms. It is not known what is the prevalence of trauma symptoms relating to COVID-19 specifically among older adults nor what may be the markers for the emergence of trauma symptoms. The aim of the present research was to estimate the prevalence, and identify correlates of, traumatic stress symptoms attributable to COVID-19 among older adults in the UK. A cross-sectional survey that assessed COVID-19-related trauma symptoms and demographics was conducted with a sample of 3012 adults aged 60 years and older who were representative of the UK population. Data were analysed descriptively and using multiple/logistic regression. 36.5% of the sample (n\\xa0=\\xa01100) reported experiencing clinically meaningful traumatic stress symptoms that could lead to as many as 27.4% of the sample going on to develop PTSD. Women and younger older adults were particularly likely to experience clinically meaningful symptoms of traumatic stress. Work is urgently required to prepare services to address what may be substantial numbers of older people presenting with PTSD in the future.',\n",

There remains no clear understanding of the mechanisms that underlie neurological symptoms in COVID-19 and whether SARS-CoV-2 has the potential for neuroinvasion in humans. In this minireview, we discuss what is known from human autopsies in fatal COVID-19, including highlighting studies that investigate for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in brain and olfactory tissue, and summarize the neuropathological consequences of infection. Incorporating microscopic and molecular findings from brain tissue into what we know about clinical disease will inform best practice management guidance and direct research priorities as it relates to neurological morbidity from COVID-19.',\n",

We review the literature to investigate: 1) Are PD patients at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 and are there specific contributing factors to that risk? 2) How does COVID-19 affect PD symptoms? 3) How does COVID-19 present in PD patients? 4) What are the outcomes in PD patients who contract COVID-19? 5) What is the impact of COVID-19 on PD care? 6) Does COVID-19 increase the risk of developing PD? A literature search was performed from 1979 to 2020 using the terms: 'Parkinson's disease' and 'parkinsonism' combined with: 'COVID-19'; 'SARS-CoV-2' and 'coronavirus'. It does not appear that PD is a specific risk factor for COVID-19. There is evidence for direct/indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 on motor/non-motor symptoms of PD. Although many PD patients present with typical COVID-19 symptoms, some present atypically with isolated worsening of parkinsonian symptoms, requiring increased anti-PD therapy and having worse outcomes. Mortality data on PD patients with COVID-19 is inconclusive (ranging from 5.2%to 100%). Patients with advanced PD appear to be particularly vulnerable. Single cases of acute hypokinetic-rigid syndrome have been described but no other convincing data has been reported. The rapidity with which COVID-19 has swept across the globe has favored the proliferation of studies which lack scientific rigor and the PD literature has not been immune. A coordinated effort is required to assimilate data and answer these questions in larger PD cohorts.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Many people report suffering from post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 or \"long-COVID\", but there are still open questions on what actually constitutes long-COVID and how prevalent it is. The current definition of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 is based on voting using the Delphi-method by the WHO post-COVID-19 working group. It emphasizes long-lasting fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction as the core symptoms of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. In this international survey study consisting of 13,628 subjects aged 18-99\\u2009years from 16 countries of Asia, Europe, North America and South America (May-Dec 2021), we show that post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 symptoms were more prevalent amongst the more severe COVID-19 cases, i.e. those requiring hospitalisation for COVID-19. We also found that long-lasting sleep symptoms are at the core of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 and associate with the COVID-19 severity when COVID-19 cases are compared with COVID-negative cases. Specifically, fatigue (61.3%), insomnia symptoms (49.6%) and excessive daytime sleepiness (35.8%) were highly prevalent amongst respondents reporting long-lasting symptoms after hospitalisation for COVID-19. Understanding the importance of sleep-related symptoms in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 has a clinical relevance when diagnosing and treating long-COVID.',\n",

Articles reporting long COVID prevalence and symptoms based on original data in the paediatric population were included. Case series quality was assessed through the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. For observational studies, adherence to STROBE checklist was evaluated. Twenty-two articles were included: 19 observational studies (12 cohort/7 cross-sectional) and 3 case series. Nine studies provided a control group. We found a high variability in terms of prevalence (1.6-70%). The most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (2-87%), headache (3.5-80%), arthro-myalgias (5.4-66%), chest tightness or pain (1.4-51%), and dyspnoea (2-57.1%). Five studies reported limitations in daily function due to long COVID. Alterations at brain imaging were described in one study, transient electrocardiographic abnormalities were described in a minority of children, while most authors did not evidence long-term pulmonary sequelae. Older age, female sex, and previous long-term pathological conditions were more frequently associated with persistent symptoms.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nLong COVID evidence in children is limited, heterogeneous, and based on low-quality studies. The lockdown consequences are difficult to distinguish from long COVID symptoms. High-quality studies are required: WHO definition of long COVID should be used, controlled clinical studies should be encouraged, and the impact of new variants on long COVID prevalence should be investigated to ensure an objective analysis of long COVID characteristics in children and a proper allocation of healthcare system resources.\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS KNOWN\\n• Children rarely develop a severe respiratory disease in the acute phase of COVID-19. • A limited number of patients develop a multisystem inflammatory condition that can lead to multiorgan failure and shock.\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS NEW\\n• Persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection are reported in children\\xa0and limitations in daily function due to long COVID symptoms affect school attendance. • Functional complaints of post-acute COVID are difficult to be distinguished from those due to social restrictions.',\n",

In the etiology of Hirschsprung disease various genes play a role; these are: RET, EDNRB, GDNF, EDN3 and SOX10, NTN3, ECE1, Mutations in these genes may result in dominant, recessive or multifactorial patterns of inheritance. Diverse models of inheritance, co-existence of numerous genetic disorders and detection of numerous chromosomal aberrations together with involvement of various genes confirm the genetic heterogeneity of Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease might well serve as a model for many complex disorders in which the search for responsible genes has only just been initiated.

This alone, however, is not sufficient to cause colonic aganglionosis as alterations in the balance of NCC proliferation and differentiation ensures NCC colonize the entire length of the gut of Tcof1(+/-) mice by E18.5. In contrast, Tcof1 haploinsufficiency is able to sensitize Pax3(+/-) mice to colonic aganglionosis.

Polygenic analysis identified 15.1 thousand variants as causally influencing MDD, and 10.8 thousand variants as influencing insomnia.

A report of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.', 'abstract': \"This report reviews data on naturally-occurring multifactorial diseases and develops a mathematical model to predict the impact of radiation-induced mutations on the frequencies of these diseases in the population. It provides an outline of the aetiological features and examples of multifactorial diseases, interpreted to arise as a result of the joint action of genetic and environmental factors. Examples include common congenital abnormalities (such as neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, cleft lip+/-palate etc.) and chronic diseases (such as coronary heart disease, essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus etc.). These diseases are not readily explained on the basis of simple mendelian patterns of inheritance. The report considers the concepts and models used to explain the inheritance patterns of multifactorial diseases with particular emphasis on the multifactorial threshold model (MTM) of disease liability. The MTM is useful for predicting risk to relatives of those affected from information on their population frequencies. In these predictions, the heritability (h(2)) provides a measure of the relative importance of transmissible genetic effects in the overall phenotypic variation. Conceptual differences between mendelian and multifactorial diseases are discussed. The genetic basis of a multifactorial disease is that a genetically susceptible individual may or may not develop the disease depending on the interaction of a number of risk factors, both genetic and environmental. Three chronic multifactorial disease entities are reviewed in depth, viz. diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension, and coronary heart disease. The report considers briefly mechanistic population genetic models developed to explain polygenic variation. The basic conclusion is that the concepts of liability and threshold (underlying the MTM model) and that of mutation-selection balance (from population genetic models) together provide a basis for developing a model for assessing the impact of radiation-induced mutations on the frequencies of multifactorial diseases in the population.The mutation component (MC) of genetic diseases quantifies the responsiveness of the genetic component of a disease to an increase in mutation rate (e.g. after radiation exposure). This report integrates the concepts of liability and threshold (from the MTM model) and of mutation-selection equilibrium (from mechanistic population genetic models) into the 'Finite Locus Threshold Model' (FLTM) for estimating MC for multifactorial diseases and the relationship between MC and h(2) of these diseases. Computer simulation studies illustrate the effects of one-time or a permanent increase in mutation rate on MC for multifactorial diseases.Finally, the report addresses the estimation of the radiation risk of multifactorial diseases. A formal revision of the estimates of risk of multifactorial diseases (and also of mendelian diseases) contained in the 1990 Recommendations of ICRP, Publication 60, must await the results of studies currently underway. While future genetic risk estimates are likely to be lower than those in current use, until the new ones become available, those provided in Publication 60 may be regarded as being adequate for use in radiological protection- they are unlikely to underestimate risk.\", 'mesh_terms': ['D000016:Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced', 'D000293:Adolescent', 'D000328:Adult', 'D015984:Causality', 'D002648:Child', 'D002675:Child, Preschool', 'D002908:Chronic Disease', 'D015331:Cohort Studies', 'D000013:Congenital Abnormalities', 'D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies', 'D005260:Female', 'D030342:Genetic Diseases, Inborn', 'D020022:Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'D005826:Genetics, Medical', 'D006801:Humans', 'D007223:Infant', 'D007231:Infant, Newborn', 'D008297:Male', 'D008875:Middle Aged', 'D008962:Models, Theoretical', 'D020412:Multifactorial Inheritance', 'D009154:Mutation', 'D011247:Pregnancy', 'D011829:Radiation Dosage', 'D011830:Radiation Effects', 'D011831:Radiation Genetics', 'D011832:Radiation Injuries', 'D011870:Radiologic Health', 'D012307:Risk Factors']}, 'd10555607': {'score': 0.25256317, 'title': 'Coronary heart disease is a multifactorial disease.', 'abstract': 'Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the Western World.

Data show that almost 300 variables are statistically associated with CHD. However, evidence suggests that the vast majority of coronary events can be explained on the basis of blood pressure, lipids, smoking, and diabetes. Laboratory, experimental, and epidemiologic data identify dyslipidemia as a pivotal CHD risk factor, in the absence of which other risk factors cease to produce any important increase in absolute risk of events. For example, in populations with relatively low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, such as China and Japan, the incidence of CHD remains low even when smoking and hypertension are highly prevalent. Observational data have clearly established that CHD risk factors tend to cluster in individuals. The impact of coexisting risk factors is greater than additive, and indeed is usually multiplicative. The implications of such an interactive effect are that relatively normal levels of two or more risk factors in coexistence may have a profound impact on risk. Despite these findings, in the past most treatment algorithms have viewed risk factors separately and have recommended discrete treatment targets. More recent guidelines have taken a broader view and provide simple, yet accurate, methods of evaluating absolute risk based on the consideration of several risk factors. Coronary heart disease is clearly a multifactorial disease with risk factors that tend to cluster and interact in an individual to determine the level of coronary risk.

A short-cut to localisation of a disease gene for an oligogenic/multifactorial disorder such as bipolar disorder may come from observation of cosegregation with a monogenic trait. We have described a family (pedigree 324) in which there was cosegregation of major affective disorder and Darier's disease, a dominantly inherited skin disorder, and hypothesised that this reflects genetic linkage between genes involved in these disorders. Genetic mapping studies have placed the locus for Darier's disease on chromosome 12q23-q24. We conducted subsequent linkage studies (1995) upon 45 bipolar families (without Darier's disease). These results showed some evidence in favour of linkage with chromosome 12q markers with maximum evidence at a trinucleotide repeat marker within intron 1 of the phospholipase A2A (PLA2A) gene.

Essential hypertension is the most frequent diagnosis in this syndrome, indicating that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors underlying essential hypertension have also been identified including age, sex, genetics, demographic factors, and others. Remarkable progress in molecular biological research has been achieved in clarifying the molecular basis of Mendelian hypertensive disorders. Causative genes and chromosomal fragments harboring disease susceptibility genes have been identified, e. g., for glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, Liddle's syndrome, mineralocorticoid excess.\\n\\n\\nMOLECULAR GENETIC STUDIES\\nMolecular genetic studies have now identified mutations in eight genes that cause Mendelian forms of hypertension and nine genes that cause Mendelian forms of hypotension in humans. No single genetic variant has emerged from linkage or association analyses as consistently related to blood pressure level in every sample and in all populations. However, a number of polymorphisms in candidate genes have been associated with differences in blood pressure. Most prominent have been the polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nEssential hypertension is likely to be a polygenic disorder that results from the inheritance of a number of susceptibility genes and involves multiple environmental determinants.

Because enteric neurons are essential for propulsive intestinal motility, infants with HSCR suffer from severe constipation and have a distended abdomen. Currently the only treatment is surgical removal of the affected bowel. HSCR has an incidence of around 1:5,000 live births, with a 4:1 male:female gender bias. Most enteric neurons arise from neural crest cells that emigrate from the caudal hindbrain and then migrate caudally along the entire gut. The absence of enteric neurons from variable lengths of the bowel in HSCR results from a failure of neural crest-derived cells to colonize the affected gut regions. HSCR is therefore regarded as a neurocristopathy. HSCR is a multigenic disorder and has become a paradigm for understanding complex factorial disorders. The major HSCR susceptibility gene is RET. The penetrance of several mutations in HSCR susceptibility genes is sex-dependent. HSCR can occur as an isolated disorder or as part of syndromes; for example, Type IV Waardenburg syndrome is characterized by deafness and pigmentation defects as well as intestinal aganglionosis. Studies using animal models have shown that HSCR genes regulate multiple processes including survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Research into HSCR and the development of enteric neurons is an excellent example of the cross fertilization of ideas that can occur between human molecular geneticists and researchers using animal models.

Derived from a multipotent, migratory cell population called the neural crest, a complete enteric nervous system is necessary for proper gut function.

One such disorder is Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), also known as congenital megacolon or intestinal aganglionosis. HSCR occurs in 1/5000 live births and typically presents with the inability to pass meconium, along with abdominal distension and discomfort that usually requires surgical resection of the aganglionic bowel. This disorder is characterized by a congenital absence of neurons in a portion of the intestinal tract, usually the distal colon, because of a disruption of normal neural crest cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, survival, and/or apoptosis. The inheritance of HSCR disease is complex, often non-Mendelian, and characterized by variable penetrance. Extensive research has identified a number of key genes that regulate neural crest cell development in the pathogenesis of HSCR including RET, GDNF, GFRα1, NRTN, EDNRB, ET3, ZFHX1B, PHOX2b, SOX10, and SHH.

Minor compounds present in mammalian-derived food include cholesterol linoleate and arachidonate. Evidence is presented that these esters are directly incorporated into VLDL and are responsible for the deleterious effects of atherosclerosis. Cholesterol esterified with these polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is readily oxidized at the PUFA residue during storage and heating. Apparently, the liver is unable to distinguish between nonoxidized and oxidized cholesterol PUFA esters and also incorporates the latter into VLDL, which is transformed to LDL. When this LDL is transferred to endothelial cells, the toxic products are liberated and induce cell damage. Cell damage is combined with structural changes that influence neighboring cells and cause an influx of Ca2+ ions and activation of phospholipases and lipoxygenases, resulting in production of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs). When the level of free PUFAs generated by phospholipases exceeds a certain limit, lipoxygenases commit suicide, causing liberation of iron ions. The latter react with LOOHs and thus induce a switch from enzymatic to nonenzymatic generation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products. Although the LOO. radicals produced in enzymatic reactions are deactivated within the enzyme complex, LOO. radicals generated in nonenzymatic reactions are able to attack any biological compound, inducing severe damage.

Absence of enteric ganglia from the distal colon are the hallmark of Hirschsprung disease, a congenital disorder characterised by severe intestinal dysmotility. Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET have been identified in approximately 50% of familial cases of Hirschsprung disease but the cellular processes misregulated in this condition remain unclear. By lineage tracing neural crest cells in mice homozygous for a knock-in allele of Ret (Ret, we demonstrate that normal activity of this receptor is required in vivo for the migration of enteric nervous system progenitors throughout the gut. In mutant mice, progenitors of enteric neurons fail to colonise the distal colon, indicating that failure of colonisation of the distal intestine is a major contributing factor for the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease. Enteric nervous system progenitors in the ganglionic proximal guts of mutant mice are also characterised by reduced proliferation and differentiation. These findings suggest that the functional abnormalities in Hirschsprung disease result from a combination of colonic aganglionosis and deficits in neuronal circuitry of more proximal gut segments. The reduced neurogenesis in the gut of Ret mutants was reproduced in the multilineage enteric nervous system progenitors isolated from these animals. Correction of the molecular defects of such progenitors fully restored their neurogenic potential in culture.

MWS is a relatively newly identified disorder, and even MWS patients without Hirschsprung disease can be diagnosed easily based on clinical findings alone.', 'mesh_terms': ['D004247:DNA', 'D004252:DNA Mutational Analysis', 'D005091:Exons', 'D019066:Facies', 'D016368:Frameshift Mutation', 'D006627:Hirschsprung Disease', 'D018398:Homeodomain Proteins', 'D006801:Humans', 'D007223:Infant', 'D008607:Intellectual Disability', 'D008297:Male', 'D008831:Microcephaly', 'D010641:Phenotype', 'D012097:Repressor Proteins', 'D000074165:Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 2', 'D016335:Zinc Fingers']}, 'd15617541': {'score': 0.23759180000000002, 'title': \"Studying the genetics of Hirschsprung's disease: unraveling an oligogenic disorder.\", 'abstract': \"Hirschsprung's disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of the gastrointestinal tract. Genetic dissection was successful as nine genes and four loci for Hirschsprung's disease susceptibility were identified. Different approaches were used to find these loci such as classical linkage in large families, identity by descent mapping in an inbred kindred, candidate gene approaches based on naturally occurring mutant mice models, and finally the use of model-free linkage and association analyzes. In this study, we review the identification of genes and loci involved in the non-syndromic common form and syndromic Mendelian forms of Hirschsprung's disease. The majority of the identified genes are related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease. The non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung's disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model. We discuss the practical implications of the elucidation of genes associated with Hirschsprung's disease susceptibility for genetic counseling. Finally, we speculate on possible strategies to identify new genes for Hirschsprung's disease.\", 'mesh_terms': ['D005192:Family Health', 'D020022:Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'D005823:Genetics', 'D006627:Hirschsprung Disease', 'D006801:Humans', 'D040582:Inheritance Patterns', 'D020412:Multifactorial Inheritance']}, 'd20945983': {'score': 0.23756008, 'title': \"Autosomal recessive mutations in the development of Parkinson's disease.\", 'abstract': \"Although Parkinson's disease was long considered a nongenetic disorder, it is now clear that there are multiple predisposing genes, and that the disorder can exhibit either Mendelian or non-Mendelian modes of inheritance. The identification of several of these genes has provided important insights into the pathogenesis of this common complex disorder. This article presents an overview of the genes associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, including Parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), DJ1 (PARK7) and ATP13A2 (PARK9). Recently, it was recognized that mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are associated with an increased incidence of parkinsonism. While Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder, patients with Parkinson's disease can be Gaucher heterozygotes or homozygotes. Elucidating the basis for this association may shed light on new disease mechanisms that contribute to the development of parkinsonism.\", 'mesh_terms': ['D005776:Gaucher Disease', 'D005962:Glucosylceramidase', 'D006801:Humans', 'D047908:Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'D009154:Mutation', 'D015513:Oncogene Proteins', 'D010300:Parkinson Disease', 'D000071617:Protein Deglycase DJ-1', 'D011494:Protein Kinases', 'D006180:Proton-Translocating ATPases', 'D044767:Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']}, 'd20851255': {'score': 0.23750416000000002, 'title': 'Triglyceride-mediated pathways and coronary heart disease.', 'abstract': '', 'mesh_terms': ['D000072040:Apolipoprotein A-V', 'D001054:Apolipoproteins A', 'D003327:Coronary Disease', 'D005838:Genotype', 'D006801:Humans', 'D057182:Mendelian Randomization Analysis', 'D020641:Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'D012307:Risk Factors', 'D014280:Triglycerides']}, 'd23899067': {'score': 0.23741678, 'title': 'Hirschsprung disease and use of calretinin in inadequate rectal suction biopsies.', 'abstract': 'CONTEXT\\nUp to 17% of all rectal suction biopsies performed in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease are considered inadequate. In most instances, inadequate biopsies contain too little submucosa or are taken within the anal transition zone.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\nTo examine the utility of calretinin stain in the workup of inadequate biopsies for patients with clinical suspicion of Hirschsprung disease.\\n\\n\\nDESIGN\\nA retrospective analysis was conducted of all rectal suction biopsies performed in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease during the previous 12 years that were considered \"inadequate.\" Seventeen cases were identified, and Hirschsprung disease status was determined by clinical or surgical follow-up. Immunohistochemistry for calretinin was performed for all cases containing columnar mucosa, which were evaluated without knowledge of clinical course.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nAll 12 patients without Hirschsprung disease had calretinin-positive nerve fibers in the lamina propria or muscularis mucosae, and all 5 patients with Hirschsprung disease had no calretinin staining of nerves.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIn this retrospective series, calretinin immunohistochemistry correctly predicted outcome in all instances. Although the gold standard for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease in rectal suction biopsies remains the evaluation of ganglion cells in a hematoxylin-eosin staining with sufficient submucosa, calretinin immunohistochemistry is quite helpful in triaging further workup based on clinical suspicion.', 'mesh_terms': ['D000293:Adolescent', 'D015415:Biomarkers', 'D001707:Biopsy, Needle', 'D064032:Calbindin 2', 'D016022:Case-Control Studies', 'D002648:Child', 'D002675:Child, Preschool', 'D005260:Female', 'D006627:Hirschsprung Disease', 'D006801:Humans', 'D007150:Immunohistochemistry', 'D007223:Infant', 'D007231:Infant, Newborn', 'D007413:Intestinal Mucosa', 'D008297:Male', 'D009412:Nerve Fibers', 'D012007:Rectum', 'D012189:Retrospective Studies', 'D064030:S100 Calcium Binding Protein G']}}\n"
